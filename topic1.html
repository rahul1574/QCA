        <p>In today’s computers, binary information is encoded using current switches. The on and off 
            states of current switches represent bit “1” and “0” respectively. In a transistor, when the 
            gate voltage is less than the threshold voltage, there is no current flow; the transistor is off. 
            Only when the gate voltage is greater than the threshold voltage is there current flow. The 
            conventional transistor-based CMOS technology has followed Moore’s Law, doubling 
            transistors every 18 months. Shrinking transistors has been the major trend to achieve 
            circuits with fast speed, high densities and low power dissipation. However, when scaling 
            comes down to submicron level, many problems occur. Physical limits such as quantum 
            effects and non-deterministic behavior of small currents and technological limits like power 
            dissipation and design complexity may hinder the further progress of microelectronics using 
            conventional circuit scaling. A new paradigm, beyond current switches to encode binary 
            information, may be needed. Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) emerges as such a 
            paradigm. It was proposed by Lent et al. in 1993 [1]. Since then, a significant amount of 
            research has been done in QCA both theoretically and experimentally [2-58]. It has become 
            one of the promising candidates for nano-computing. QCA encodes binary information in 
            the charge configuration within a cell. Coulomb interaction between cells is sufficient to 
            accomplish the computation in QCA arrays—thus no interconnect wires are needed 
            between cells. No current flows out of the cell so that low power dissipation is possible.

        <p>A simple QCA cell consists of four quantum dots arranged in a square, dots are simply places 
            where a charge can be localized. There are two extra electrons in the cell that are free to 
            move between the four dots. Tunneling in or out of a cell is suppressed. The numbering of 
            the dots in the cell goes clockwise starting from the dot on the top right. A polarization P in 
            a cell, which measures the extent to which the electronic charge is distributed among the 
            four dots, is therefore defined as 
        </p>
        <div id="image3"></div>
        <p>where ρi denotes the electronic charge at dot i. Because of Coulomb repulsion, the 
            electrons will occupy antipodal sites. The two polarized charge configurations P = −1 and P = 
            1 correspond bit value of 0 and 1 respectively. These two states are used to encode the 
            binary information. When a polarized cell is placed close to another cell in line, the Coulomb 
            interaction between them will force the second cell switch into the same state as the first 
            cell, minimizing the electrostatic energy in the charge configuration of the cells. Based on 
            the Coulomb interaction between cells, fundamental QCA devices can be built. 
            A binary wire can be realized with a line of cells to transmit information from one cell to 
            another. Two diagonally aligned cells will have the opposite polarization. Inverters can 
            therefore be implemented with lines of diagonally aligned cells. A majority gate can be built 
            with five cells. The top, left and bottom cells are inputs. The device cell in the center 
            interacts with the three inputs and its result (the majority of the input bits) will be 
            propagated to the cell on the right. A majority gate is the basic logic gate in QCA, as it can 
            function as an “OR” gate with one of the inputs fixed to “1” and function as an “AND” gate 
            with one of the inputs fixed to “0”.

        <div id="head1">Metallic QCA cells</div>
        <p>QCA devices exist. Metal dot QCA cells are built with metallic tunnel junctions and very 
            small capacitors. Aluminum islands form the dots and aluminum oxide tunnel junctions 
            serve as the tunneling paths between dots. Figure 1.3 illustrates the implementation of a 
            four-dot QCA cell [22]. Electrons can tunnel between dot 1 and dot 2 and between dot 3 and 
            dot 4 through tunnel junctions. Figure 1.4 is a scanning electron micrograph of the four-dot 
            cell. The four red dots indicate the positions of the four metal islands. The two magenta dots 
            represent single electron transistor electrometers that are used to measure the output. The 
            fabrication technique uses a combination of electron beam lithography and dual-angle 
            evaporation to deposit thin lines of aluminum that form overlaps with a small area. The lines 
            of aluminum thus form dots and the thin layer of aluminum oxide within the overlaps form 
            the tunnel junction. The area of the tunnel junction is about 50nm × 50nm and the thickness 
            of the aluminum oxide is about 2nm. The experiment is performed in a dilution refrigerator 
            at a magnetic field of 1 Tesla to suppress the superconducting effect in aluminum. Figure 1.5 
            shows the measured characteristics of a four-dot cell *27+. The differential input (V1 − V2) is 
            applied between dot 1 and 2 with coupling capacitors. ΦD1, ΦD2, ΦD3, ΦD4 are the 
            measured dot potentials. When a positive input is applied, an electron tunnels from dot 2 to 
            dot 1, which in turn will switch an electron from dot 3 to dot 4 due to the capacitively 
            coupling between dot 1 and dot 3 and between dot 2 and dot 4. 
            Metal dot QCA devices have been successfully demonstrated at low temperatures. Majority 
            logic gates, binary wires, memories, and clocked multi-stage shift registers have all been 
            fabricated.

        <p>The schematic of the majority gate experiment which corresponds above. Four aluminum 
            dots are connected in a ring by tunnel junctions. Each dot is coupled to a metal gate through 
            a gate capacitor. The differential signal A( between gate 1 and 3), B (between gate 1 and 2) 
            and C (between gate 2 and 4) constitute the three inputs. The output is the differential 
            potential between dot 3 and dot 4. Electrometers are used to measure the potential in dot 3 
            and dot 4. Figure 1.7 demonstrates the operation of the majority gate. The experiment 
            result and theory matches very well. The data confirms the majority gate operation in QCA. 
            These metal-dot QCA devices, though limited by the fabrication method to low temperature 
            operation, provide valuable demonstrations of QCA circuits. They serve as prototypes for 
            molecular systems that will function at room temperature.

        <div id="head2">Clocking in QCA </div>
        <p>In Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA), clocks play a vital role in coordinating the 
            operations of the system. QCA is a novel computing paradigm that exploits the quantum 
            properties of charge and polarization in Nano scale structures to perform computational 
            tasks. 
            The four clock phases operate in a cyclic manner, with each clock phase lagging behind the 
            previous one. This staggered clocking is crucial for the QCA circuit's operation because it 
            ensures a smooth and controlled flow of information - A group of QCA cells will be in one of the four clock phases at any given time. - Cells in clock0 phase will transition to clock1, those in clock1 will move to clock2, and so on. - The periodic cycling through these phases allows for synchronized data movement through 
            the QCA network, effectively preventing data  
            Collisions  and ensuring orderly processing. 
            In a QCA circuit, the clock phases are typically distributed spatially: 
            - Adjacent cells are assigned different clock phases to facilitate the movement of 
            information. - For example, a cell in clock0 Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a technology for 
            designing digital circuits that use quantum dots to represent binary information. One of the 
            key features of QCA is its use of a clocking mechanism to control the flow of information 
            through a circuit. The clocking scheme in QCA typically involves multiple clock phases, 
            usually denoted as clock0, clock1, clock2, and clock3. Here is an explanation of how these 
            clocks work: 
            1. Clock0: Initialization Phase - Function: During this phase, the QCA cells are initialized. The potential wells of the 
            quantum dots are raised, making the cells lose their polarization and return to a neutral 
            state. - Effect on Cells: The cells do not hold any logical state (i.e., they are in a reset state). 
            2. Clock1: Propagation Phase - Function: In this phase, the potential wells begin to lower slightly, allowing the cells to 
            start capturing the polarization from their neighbors. - Effect on Cells: Cells begin to polarize based on the state of their neighboring cells, 
            essentially allowing information to propagate through the circuit. 
            3. Clock2: Hold Phase - Function: The potential wells are fully lowered during this phase, firmly locking the 
            polarization state of the cells. - Effect on Cells: Cells maintain their current logical state, acting as storage elements. 
            4. Clock3: Release Phase - Function: The potential wells begin to rise again, preparing the cells to return to the 
            initialization phase. - Effect on Cells: Cells gradually lose their polarization, transitioning back to a neutral state 
            in readiness for the next cycle. 
            Cycle of Clock Phases 
            Phase will pass its state to a neighboring cell in clock1 phase, which will then hold the state 
            and pass it to another cell in clock2 phase, and so forth. - Clock0: Resets the cells to a neutral state. - Clock1: Allows cells to polarize and start propagating data. - Clock2: Locks the cells’ states to hold information. 
            - Clock3: Prepares cells to return to a neutral state, ready for the next cycle.
