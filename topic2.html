        <p>In Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA), wires are fundamental components that facilitate 
            the transmission of binary information across the circuit. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of 
            QCA wires:
        </p>
        <div id="head1">Structure of QCA Wires </div>
        <p>1. Basic Cell Layout: - A QCA wire is composed of a linear array of QCA cells. - Each cell consists of four quantum dots positioned at the corners of a square, with two 
            excess electrons that can tunnel between dots. 
        </p>
        <p>2. Cell Polarization: - The binary state of each cell is determined by the position of the two electrons, resulting 
            in two possible polarizations:  - Polarization (P = +1) (representing binary '1') - Polarization (P = -1) (representing)</p>
        <div id="head2">Working Principle</div>
        <p>1. Columbic Interaction: - The state of each QCA cell is influenced by the electrostatic interaction with its 
            neighboring cells. This interaction allows the cells to propagate their polarization state along 
            the wire.
        </p>
        <p>- When a cell is polarized, it affects the polarization of adjacent cells, allowing a binary 
            signal to travel through the wire. 
        </p>
        <p>2. Clocking Mechanism: - The operation of QCA wires is controlled by a four-phase clocking system. Each phase 
            (clock0, clock1, clock2, clock3) manages the state of the cells, ensuring synchronized and 
            directional information flow.
        </p> 
        <p> - Cells in different clock phases help propagate the signal in a stepwise manner, similar to a 
            conveyor belt moving items along its path.
        </p>
        <div id="head3">Types of QCA Wires</div>
        <p>1. 90-Degree Wire: - The simplest form of a QCA wire is a straight line where each cell is aligned with its 
            neighbors.
        </p.>
        <p.>- The signal travels directly from one cell to the next in a linear fashion.
        </p>
        <p>2. 45-Degree Wire: - Cells are positioned diagonally, creating a wire that can change direction. - This type is used for routing signals around corners and is essential for more complex 
            circuit layouts. 
        </p>
        <div id="head3">Signal Propagation </div>
        <p>1. Binary Information Transfer: - Binary information is transferred by the sequential polarization of cells, where the 
            polarization state of one cell influences the next.</p>
        <p>The clocking mechanism ensures that each cell goes through phases of initialization, 
            propagation, hold, and release, allowing the signal to move step-by-step along the wire.
        </p>
        <p>2. Signal Integrity: - The clocking ensures that signals do not propagate uncontrollably and maintains the 
            integrity of the binary information.</p> 
        <p>- Proper clocking and layout prevent issues such as signal degradation and unintended 
            polarization.
